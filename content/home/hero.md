## Computer Engineering Student and Hobby Programmer

Welcome to my website! I am Emil, a computing student at the University of Zagreb who gets excited about **RISC-V processors**, **HPC**, **LLMs**, **self-hosted solutions**, and **privacy-focused technology**. I like using tech and programming to solve real-world problems. Feel free to browse the site to see what I have been working on, or contact me if you have any questions.
