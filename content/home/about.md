# About me

Hi! I am Emil, currently a computing student at [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/studies/bachelor/computing) interested in **HPC**, **RISC-V** processors, **LLMs**, **backend** development and **privacy-focused technology**. I work with everything from RISC-V architecture to modern authentication methods.

> I like using tech and programming to solve real-world problems (however small, silly, or niche they may be). For instance, after getting annoyed at the fact that my university does not send the students an email when their timetable changes, I built a web app that monitors calendars and notifies studnets of any changes - and let everyone use it.

## What I'm Learning

**Self-hosted infrastructure:**

Right now I'm exploring self-hosted services by making a home server running Immich, Nextcloud, Syncthing and a mail server (among many others); and improving my home network by replacing the ISP router with OPNsense to understand how software deployments, backups, and network design and management work in practice.

**Backend development:**

I am also looking into backend development and authentication to learn how users and data are managed in modern web apps. To do that, I am developing a Python all-in-one authentication package to open-source and potentially use in future apps.

**Hardware design:**

I am starting to dive into SystemVerilog and Xilinx platforms and preparing to start work on my bachelor thesis - making a RISC-V CPU that can run an OS and application programs. This project is a collaboration with my friend and colleague who is developing the OS.

## What I enjoy

When I'm not coding, I spend time 3D printing, doing photography, creating digital art and reading essays on philosophy. I also enjoy experimenting with self-hosted applications because I believe in controlling your own data.

## What I'm Building

This site is part of my learning journey, a place to document projects, share what I discover, and connect with others who are excited about technology. Check out my [blog](https://emilpopovic.me/blog) to learn more about some of my projects. If you have any questions or just want to talk to me, see the [contact](https://emilpopovic.me/contact) page.

## What's Next

I'm excited to dive deeper into HPC applications and explore how RISC-V processors and accelerators can be optimized for specific workloads. I'm also looking forward to contributing to open-source projects that align with my values.
